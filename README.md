# Brain Network Toolbox (BNT)

BNT can be seen as a repository of MATLAB&#174; scripts and functions that contributed to paper publications in the field brain connectivity. It is being continuously and jointly developed by scientists of the [ARAMIS LAB](http://www.aramislab.fr) at the [Brain and Spine Institute](https://icm-institute.org), Paris, FR and the University College of London, UK.

## Installation

The simplest way to install this toolbox is to download the [latest toolbox package file](https://github.com/brain-network/bnt/releases), double-click on it and follow the instructions.

If you want to install this toolbox in a specific location, you can download the [zip file](), extract it and add this location to your MATLAB&#174; path 

## Getting started
